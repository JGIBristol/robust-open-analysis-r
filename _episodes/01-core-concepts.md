Core concepts in reproducibility. This will cover basic elements that go wrong in common research practices (and that the skills covered in this workshop will help ameliorate), e.g. p-hacking, HARKing, FAIR principles, publication bias, power etc., and how they lead to bad science. Participants will identify and discuss how these issues affect their own research areas.
