## About this course

- __Aim__: 
    - To make your research easier, more enjoyable, and more reproducible.
- **Delivery**:
    - Short presentations
    - Group discussions (with concept maps)
   - Practicals
- **Outcomes**:
    - Understand four roadblocks of reproducible research: P-hacking, HARKing, Publication Bias, and Un"FAIR"ness
    - Understand some solutions to these problems: Preregistration, Registered Reportsk, Literate programming in Rmarkdown, Versions control, the Open Science Framework, and FAIR principles

```{r, echo=F, out.width='95%', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics('fig/pink.png')
```

*** =right
Green post-it means you're finished:
```{r, echo=F, out.width='95%', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics('fig/green.png')
```
