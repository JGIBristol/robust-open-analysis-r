Instructor Notes
=================

This extras page is designed to help other people teach the ROAR course for the first time. 

## Carpentries philosophy
These materials are designed with the Carpentries philosophy in mind, which means that they are designed specifically for an interactive learning style, with live-coding exercises during which learners should be able to follow-along in real time, ask questions, and get help if they need it.

The exercises on the welcome page are designed to help you create an environment where this is possible, by making sure that everyone knows:
- how to signal that they are finished with exercises (i.e. reactions on zoom, e.g. tick/cross or post-it notes)
- how to access help (e.g. hands up IRL, or ask questions in the chat and self-assign to break-out rooms on Zoom)
- that they are welcome and safe here and how they should behave (Code of Conduct) 

## Preparing for the lesson

### Notes for organising a non-Carpentries workshop
The Welcome page of these lesson materials (under "extras") contains a draft timetable for the workshop, the date, and photos of the instructors/organisers, so you will need to edit that page if you want to use it.

A week before the workshop, email the participants:
- Letting them know where to find the workshop materials, what the timetable is for the day, and joining instructions.
- Asking them to ensure that they have followed the setup instructions before the workshop. If you're running one, also include a link to a drop-in installation help session.
- **Asking them to download the latest version of Zoom**: this will ensure that self-assigned breakout rooms work for the majority of participants. 
- A link to a pre-workshop survey (asking for example what kind of prior experience participants have)
- Asking to get in touch if the participants need any special accomodations.

Immediately after the workshop, send out a thanks for attending email with a reminder about the post-workshop survey (asking how useful they found each episode, and any suggestions for improvement).

### Notes for organising a Carpentries workshop

The Welcome page of these lesson materials (under "extras") contains a draft timetable for the workshop, the date, and photos of the instructors/organisers, so you will need to edit that page if you want to use it.

Apart from that this workshop can be used in exactly the same way as other Carpentries lesson materials.

## Common learner misconceptions

### RStudio

**1/. Why choose RStudio local versus RStudio cloud?**
We recommend RStudio cloud for the workshop event because its easier to get everything set up. We are not able to help with installations on the day because many participants don't have permission to install what they need and need help from IT.

However, once you have it set up, your local RStudio is better in many the following ways:
- Each new Project in RStudio.cloud is a new cloud instance (i.e. a new computer), so you'll need to install all the packages again (e.g. to use RMarkdown) for each new project and configure Git again.
- In RStudio local, you can keep data privately on your computer without sharing it with the cloud.

### RMarkdown

### Git/GitHub

**1/. What's the difference between _configuring_ and _initialising_?**
Configuring is a one-time (per computer) introducing yourself to Git while initialising is a once per project telling Git that you want to track changes of everything in a folder.

This is especially confusing with respect to RStudio Cloud,  because things that you only usually do once per computer (i.e. configuring) must be done once per project, because each new RStudio.cloud project is a new cloud instance (new computer).

## Tips for instructors
- Practice your screen setup and screen-sharing in Zoom.
