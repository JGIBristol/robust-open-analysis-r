## Why are we here?
- __Aim__: 
    - To make your research easier, more enjoyable, and more reproducible.
    - Be guided through a workflow for open and reproducible research.
- **Delivery**:
    - Short presentations
    - Group discussions (with concept maps)
    - Practicals
- **Outcomes**:
    - Understand the motivations for working reproducibly. 
    - Understand how Rmarkdown can be used to create resources in different formats.
    - Be confident pulling and pushing to GitHub using Git.

## Post-it notes

Post-it notes tell us how you're feeling (no post-it means you're getting on with something)

*** =left
Pink post-it means you'd like some help or that we're going too fast:
```{r, echo=F, out.width='95%', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics('fig/pink.png')
```

*** =right
Green post-it means you're finished:
```{r, echo=F, out.width='95%', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics('fig/green.png')
```

## Introductions: Your turn!

If you haven't already: Sign up for a GitHub account!

Go to: [hackmd.io/@nataliethurlby/ROAR](https://hackmd.io/@nataliethurlby/ROAR/edit)

Introduce yourself by writing: _Your Name + Your university and department + an emoji that represents your research + an emoji that represents your week._

## Tech setup

Let's check these three things together:
* Open RStudio
* Check packages installed
* Try to create a new project with version control
* Sign up for the Open Science Framework [osf.io](https://osf.io/)
